# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

- Here's the question I made for this week. The topic is Data Preprocessing. Please download the zip file and upload the notebook and the .csv file to your own Jupyter notebook.

- This question should take about 5-10 minutes to complete. If you need any help, just Google it. Everyone in the industry uses it, and finding information online is a skill too. 
However, please try and do the problem without looking at the solution. 

- Let me know if there's anything I can do to do improve this type of problem for next week. Please feel free to email me at daniel.fang@colorado.edu.
